# WorkersGenerator
An application for generating a dataset.

*P.S. This is my first experience in iOS app development. This application was written in a week, so there is no optimization here. Feel free using this code.*
## Options
 - *Phone Provider.* 
 Use the slider to change the desired number (in percent) of people using the selected telecom operator. You can also use an additional slider to change the number of people who prefer to use a different region code.
 - *Profession.*
 Change the percentages between professions. 50% of the CEO means that 50% of the persons will be CEO.
 - *Salary.*
 Set default salaries for employees by position. You can additionally specify (as a percentage) how many people work as an intern.
